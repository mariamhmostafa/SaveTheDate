## 💡 About the Game

In this short and sweet game, the **groom** runs through a level, **jumping** and **collecting objects**. Upon reaching the **bride**, the scene transitions into a beautifully themed **wedding venue** — where the final screen reveals the **wedding date, location, and details**.
